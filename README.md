# Mac Artifact Viewer

Parse forensic artifacts on a MacOS system. This program does not currently analyze live systems, only disk images. So you will need to mount a disk image of a MacOS system before running this.

Current features:
- Recent Item parsing
- Internet Artifacts (History, Downloads, Bookmarks, Logins)
- Spotlight-V100 parsing

More to come.
